# trid - Turkish Citizenship ID Number type crate for Rust
This is my first Rust package derived from my [TurkishId](https://github.com/ssg/TurkishId) package in .NET.

# usage
The package provides an `is_valid(value: &str)` function for validating ID numbers and a `TurkishId` 
struct to encompass a Turkish citizenship ID number, so you don't need to validate it constantly.
